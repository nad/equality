import Prelude.Size

-- Logical equivalences.

import Logical-equivalence

-- Two logically equivalent axiomatisations of equality. Many of the
-- modules below are parametrised by a definition of equality that
-- satisfies these axioms.
--
-- The reason for this parametrisation was that I thought that I might
-- later want to use a definition of equality where the application
-- elim P r (refl x) did not compute to r x, unlike the equality in
-- Equality.Propositional. Now, with the advent of cubical type theory
-- and paths, there is such an equality (see Equality.Path).
--
-- (Note that Equality.Tactic contains a definition of equality which,
-- roughly speaking, computes like the one in Equality.Propositional.)

--
-- In the module Tree-sort.Full indexed types are used to enforce

--
-- The implementation using containers has the advantage of uniform
-- definitions of Any/membership/bag equivalence, but the other
-- implementations use more direct definitions and are perhaps a bit
-- "leaner".
